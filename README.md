# Text Adventure

This project is a simple text adventure game that is written in java. It is played by entering your choices through the console. Currently
it is in an un-finished state and as such is not currently playable. Though basic functionality has now been implemented. The player can now traverse the map, engage in very basic combat with a single enemy type and will encounter three different types of area. Each of these areas requires a different solution to a problem in order to continue forwards.
